#+TITLE: 00 - Meta

** What is machine learning an why should I learn about it?

- Big data also hits biology
- Examples: Promoter searches
- Deep Learning
- AI

** Aim of the course
- Given an overview of commonly used machine learning approaches
- Show selected examples where they are applied in bioinformatics to
  answer biological questions
- Enable to apply machine learning approaches practically

** Contact 
Konrad FÃ¶rstner - konrad.foerstner@uni-wuerzburg.de

** Etherpad
There is an etherpad in the WueCampus2 course page where questions,
links and feedback can stored.

** Participants survey 1
- In which semester are you?
- Biology / Computer Science?
- General programming skill level from 0 (none) - 10 (hacker star) 
- Programming skills Python from 0 (none) - 10 (hacker star)
- Would be a basic introduction be necessary?

** Time
- Thursdays 15:00 (s. t.) - 16:45
- Would a biweekly (15:00 to 16:30) be possible/wanted?

** Class assessment
- The type of the assessment depends on the number of
  participants. The options:
  1) Presentation of a publication and/or data analysis with presentation ca. (10 - 15 min)
  2) written exam

- Will decided until the second class

** Course material
- All material will be made available as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][Open Educational Resources]] on
  [[https://github.com/konrad/2017-SS-Course-Machine_Learning_in_Bioinformatics/blob/master/Sources.org][GitHub]] and also put into WueCampus2
- The repository will be updated during the semester

** Further reading / literature list / videos
- There is not one single book or article that covers everything
- A list of recommended source can be found here: [[file:Sources.org][Sources.org]]

** Bring your own device (BYOD) vs. using the computer of the CIP pool
- Is it possible for everybody to bring a laptop or should we use the
  computers of the CIP pool?

** Software installation
- Not immediately necessary - practical part will start after the 3rd class
- [[https://docs.continuum.io/][Anaconda]] 
- [[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter Notebook]]

** Feedback
- This is the first instance of the course => feedback is highly appreciated
- evaluations sheets at mid-term and the end of the course

** Short Demo of Jupyter Notebook
