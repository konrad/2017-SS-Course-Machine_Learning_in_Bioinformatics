#+TITLE: Meta - Machine Learning in Bioinformatics

** What is machine learning an why should I learn about it?

- Machine learning (ML) is widely and increasingly used in today's life
- ML has a long history in bioinformatics - e.g. Hidden-Markov-Models
  are used since the 1980s to detect pattern in sequence data
- Meanwhile "big data" also hits biology

** Rapidly increasing amount of data in biology e.g. due to high-throuput sequencing

** There are numerous applications in biology

** We will cover all three types of machine learning in this course

1) Supervised learning (Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, etc.)
2) Unsupervised learning (Clustering etc.)
3) Reinforcement learning (Neural Networks, Baysian Networks etc.)

** Aim of the course
- Equip you with an overview of commonly used machine learning
  approaches
- Show selected examples where they are applied in bioinformatics to
  answer biological questions
- Enable you to apply machine learning approaches practically

** Contact 
Konrad FÃ¶rstner - konrad.foerstner@uni-wuerzburg.de

** Etherpad
There is an etherpad in the WueCampus2 course page where questions,
links and feedback can be placed

** Participants survey
- In which semester are you?
- Biology / Computer Science?
- General programming skill level from 0 (none) - 10 (hacker star) 
- Programming skills Python from 0 (none) - 10 (hacker star)
- Would be a basic programming introduction be necessary?

** Time
- Thursdays 15:00 (s. t.) - 16:45
- Would a biweekly (15:00 to 16:30) be possible/wanted?

** Class assessment
- The type of the assessment depends on the number of
  participants. The options:
  1) Presentation of a publication and/or data analysis with presentation ca. (10 - 15 min)
  2) Written exam

- Will be decided until the second class

** Course material
- All material will be made available as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][Open Educational Resources]] on
  [[https://github.com/konrad/2017-SS-Course-Machine_Learning_in_Bioinformatics/][GitHub]] and also put into WueCampus2
- The repository will be updated during the semester

** Further reading / literature list / videos
- There is not one single book or article that covers everything
- A list of recommended source can be found here: [[file:Sources.org][Sources.org]]

** Bring your own device (BYOD) vs. using the computer of the CIP pool
- Is it possible for everybody to bring a laptop or should we use the
  computers of the CIP pool?

** Software installation
- Not immediately necessary - practical part will start after the 3rd class
- We will use [[http://python.org/][Python]] and do our exercises/analyses in [[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter
  Notebook]]. The easiers way to install all requirement is via
  [[https://docs.continuum.io/][Anaconda]].

** Feedback
- This is the first instance of the course - feedback is highly appreciated
- Evaluations sheets at mid-term and the end of the course
 
** Short Demo of Jupyter Notebook
